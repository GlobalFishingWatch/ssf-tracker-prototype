# ssf-tracker-prototype
Prototyping a low-cost low-power GPS tracker for small scale fishing vessels


## Project Goal
Develop a simple, robust, low cost hardware device that can be used for location tracking
for small-scale fishing vessels in a global context.

Pilot test the device and develop a plan to scale it out to >100k vessels.

GFW will develop cloud back end, web and app-based UX tools for interacting with the data, probably in house but potentially with a partner.

Data from the small vessels will be combined with other data GFW collects for larger vessels to provide a richer picture of what is happening.
