# SSF Tracker Device Dashboard

This app connects to a local instance of the tracker device using Bluetooth LE (BLE).

This will only work in Chrome, and you need to enable BLE in Chrome before it will be able to connect.

To enable BLE in the browser, navigate to `chrome://flags/experimental-web-platform-features` and set it to `Enabled`

Then open index.html and you should be able to connect to the device and control it
