# Device requirements

## Desired hardware characteristics

* Total 5-year cost of ownership < $500.  This includes
  * up front hardware cost
  * hardware replacement cost, depending on failure rate
  * data communications service
* Coverage: global between latitude -50 and +50
* Data collected: lat/lon, time, speed
* Data logging frequency: 5-10 miuntes
* Data transmission frequency: not longer than 4 hours, otherwise as often as power permits
* Hardware package:
  * As simple as possible.
  * Ideally it is permanently sealed - needs to stand up to rough treatment and maritme conditions
  * Only needs one indicator light
  * Wireless charging and configuration (BLE?)
  * Only needs one button (for activation & SOS)
  * Does not have to be pretty
* Power
  * Internal rechargeable battery
  * Can have solar power (but don't count on optimal placement for captureing solar.  Assume 10% of rated solar caapcity)
* Weight and size
  * Will be attached to the structure of the boat (probably with zip ties)
  * Can be heavy and bulky, but cannot have anything sticking out that can get broken off
* Trial locations
  * Indonesia (with GFW staff)
  * Philippines (with Rare staff)
* Intellectual property license
  * Generally, everything we do is open source, so fully open source hardware and software design would be great
  * GFW publishes all our software under Apache 2.0 and data under CC-BY-NC
