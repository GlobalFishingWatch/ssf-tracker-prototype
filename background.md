# Purpose and background

There are about 3 million small fishing vessels (generally less that 12m length, operating out of fishing villages across the global south, especially Indonesia, Philippines and West Africa.

Small scale fishing is responsible for about half of the global catch globally. Unsustainalbe over-fishing and encroachment from large scale industrial fishing threatens livelihoods of the small scale fishers and the communities that depend on them.

Many NGOs and government programs are woking to make management of these fisheries more sustainable with diverse strategies.

One thing that most of the management plans have in common is the need to better understand where and when fishing is happening, and provide mechanism to detect rules violations such as fishing in off limits areas, out of season and exceeding quotas.

This is generally accomplished through some sort of opt-in location tracking of the fishing vessels, often with a system for transparency so that all participants can see their own tracking data as well as all the other members of the fishery.

GFW has ben experimenting in Indonesia with various tracking hardware and software systems, and to date we have not found any off the shelf solution that can scale effectively.

Most trials by orgs like GFW will deploy 10, 100 or occasionally up to 1000 devices, but none have managed to find a system that can scale to the 100K+ level that is needed.

The primary barriers to wider adoption are
* Cost for hardware and associated data communications service
* Hardware reliability
* Data communication when the vessel is far from shore

All devices we have tried that meet performance needs are too expensive to be sustainable long term without subsidies from non-profits (the primary source) or government.   We are looking for a solution that can be sustained by the commercial activirty of the fishery where it is used, which means that the total system cost needs to be less than the incremental value that the system produces witin the fishery on a per-vessel basis.
